# HTTPServer

This basic server is my attempt at the http server project run by TPH, which can be found [here](https://theprogrammershangout.com/resources/projects/http-project-guide/).

### Installation:
Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/redawl/HTTPServer.git
```
Create config.txt in the projects root directory, and add these three lines:
```
host: (your local IPv4 address)
port: (number of your choice)
web_directory: (where you keep your server files)
```
After that,  run main.py using your python interpreter, and you should be good to go!
